It uses the [Middleman static site generator][middleman] to convert Markdown files into HTML-based documentation that looks consistent with the GOV.UK and GDS style and format.

It is suitable for multiple styles of documentation, including API documentation.

## Why you should use this template

It helps technical writers manage their technical content using the [‘docs as code’][docs-as-code-blog] approach.

The Tech Docs Template is for internal use by the GDS and government community.
