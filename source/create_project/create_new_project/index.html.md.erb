# Create a new documentation project

1. Open the command line interface and navigate to your documents folder.

1. Run the following in the command line:

    ```yaml
    middleman init <project_name> -T alphagov/tech-docs-template
    ```
    where `<project_name>` is the name of your project.

1. Answer the installation questions.

1. When you see `Bundle complete!`, go to the new project folder and run `bundle install` to update the ruby gems.

## Configure your new documentation project

Configure your new documentation project by editing the `config/tech-docs.yml` in a text editor of your choice.

Two common settings to enable are collapsible navigation and search.

### Enable collapsible navigation

Add the following code to your project's `tech-docs.yml` file if necessary:

```yaml
# Enable collapsible navigation in the sidebar
collapsible_nav: true
```

### Enable search

The search function is especially useful for multipage documentation.

Add the following code to your projectâ€™s `tech-docs.yml` file if necessary:

```yaml
# Enable search
enable_search: true
```

See [configure documentation site][global-config] for more information.

## View your new documentation project

Navigate to the created documentation repo folder.

The folder will have multiple pre-populated files. You only need to amend the `/source` folder and the `config/tech-docs.yml` file.

<%= partial "partials/links" %>
