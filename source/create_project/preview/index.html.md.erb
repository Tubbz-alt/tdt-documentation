# Preview your documentation

You can start a local web server to preview your documentation site.

1. Run the following from inside your project folder:

    ```shell
    bundle exec middleman server
    ```

    This command is not the same as `bundle exec middleman build`, which creates a static HTML file for each file in your documentation project `source` folder.

1. Go to the local web server at `http://localhost:4567/` to preview your documentation.

1. Run `Ctrl-C` to stop the preview web server.
